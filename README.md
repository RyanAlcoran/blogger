# Rails Blog

My implementation of the Blogger tutorial from [jumpstartlabs](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html) via [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/ruby-on-rails).

In this project I will create a simple blog system and learn the basics of Ruby on Rails including:

Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)
Data Structures & Relationships
Routing
Migrations
Views with forms, partials, and helpers
RESTful design
Adding gems for extra features
